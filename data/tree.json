   "data": "<p>In a gradual process which began in the last quarter of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and  continued until the rise of the Nazis, Jews in the German-speaking world had made a transition from exclusion to acceptance. While until then Jews who wanted to take part in these societies usually had to convert to Christianity, a definite change took place after 1848, when many former restrictions were lifted. Jews were especially successful in the employment of these opportunities for advancement through education. It is this trend which allowed Kafka Zweig, and Benjamin to study at the university, and made the idea of Benjamin receiving a university position tenable.  Jews had become intellectual leaders in the German-speaking world. </p>\n\n\n",

As WWI broke out, Benjamin was beginning to translate the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. In 1915, at the age of 23, Benjamin moved to Munich where he met Gershom Scholem, the future founder of modern Kabbalah research, with whom he forged a close friendship that would last for many years. In Munich, Benjamin also met the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and authored a paper on the poet Hölderlin.</span></p>\n",
