Equally important, is the scene on the top left, showing Jesus exorcising a demon, watched from above by God and the Holy Spirit, with the Crucifixion in the background. On the bottom right the route of the Exodus from Egypt is depicted separately.</p>\n",

The room in the cellar is taken up by Lea (the maid), and it is doubtful whether this room is suited for living, especially when it comes to Franz.

It is one thing to help him as much as possible when he is living abroad, but it's another, when you invite him to our home and take upon yourself the responsibility and the care. This will end up at the expense of the children! … You know that I love Franz very much, and would like him to stay with me, but I ask you to make no commitments or to build up (his) hopes.\"</p>\n",

He therefore decided to withdraw his thesis, a step that brought his academic career to a halt.

In view of his situation he moved into a hotel and was immediately visited by a doctor from Port-Bou, whose report certified that &#160;Mr. Walter was suffering from cerebral congestion and a bronchial catarrh which forced him to stay in bed. The same doctor certifies that don Benjamin Walter passed away at 22:00 on the 26<sup>th</sup> of the same month, as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
