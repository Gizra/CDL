While until then Jews who wanted to take part in these societies usually had to convert to Christianity, a definite change took place after 1848, when many former restrictions were lifted. Jews were especially successful in the employment of these opportunities for advancement through education. It is this trend which allowed Kafka Zweig, and Benjamin to study at the university, and made the idea of Benjamin receiving a university position tenable.  Jews had become intellectual leaders in the German-speaking world. </p>\n\n\n",

In 1915, at the age of 23, Benjamin moved to Munich where he met Gershom Scholem, the future founder of modern Kabbalah research, with whom he forged a close friendship that would last for many years. In Munich, Benjamin also met the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and authored a paper on the poet Hölderlin.</span></p>\n",

His father, who ran a retail business, was a domineering uneducated man, while his mother was a quiet, shy, well-educated woman. &#160;Kafka suffered from his father's authoritarian attitude; this relationship left a dominant mark on his psyche, as is evident from the <i>Letter to His Father</i> (early 1920's).</p>\n<p>Kafka, who was an excellent student, studied at a German elementary school, and later in a classic German Gymnasium where High German was taught.

Despite this he wrote almost incessantly, writing stories, novels and letters. Yet, he was extremely critical regarding his works; as a result, many of his texts remained unfinished. Thus, his three famous novels, <i>The Castle</i>, <i>The Trial</i>, <i>The Missing Man</i>, as well as a number of stories were found unfinished by his close friend, the writer Max Brod. One of the most famous stories is <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, relating the story of the miserable Gregor Samsa who woke up one morning finding himself transformed into a huge insect.</p>\n",

These divulge an unknown side of Newton's personality. Besides being a scientist, Newton was an avid (though unusual) Christian believer, who took  a special interest in the Scriptures, believing that a deep understanding of the text will allow him to unravel the secrets of the end of days and to compute the date of  Christ's Second Coming and the Apocalypse. Of special importance is Newton's deep interest in  the Jewish sources, and his view regarding the role they of the Jews  in the process of salvation.</p>\n\n\n",

In 1940, in the wake of the political turmoil in Syria, it disappeared.  After 22 years, in 1962, it was suddenly presented and offered to the highest bidder on a public auction in London.  Later that year the Burgos Bible was purchased by the National Library of Israel.  The Manuscript is beautifully and delicately illuminated. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"LTR\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"RTL\"> </p>\n\n\n",

   "data": "<p>In a gradual process which began in the last quarter of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and  continued until the rise of the Nazis, Jews in the German-speaking world had made a transition from exclusion to acceptance. While until then Jews who wanted to take part in these societies usually had to convert to Christianity, a definite change took place after 1848, when many former restrictions were lifted. Jews were especially successful in the employment of these opportunities for advancement through education. It is this trend which allowed Kafka Zweig, and Benjamin to study at the university, and made the idea of Benjamin receiving a university position tenable.  Jews had become intellectual leaders in the German-speaking world. </p>\n\n\n",

As WWI broke out, Benjamin was beginning to translate the poetry of Charles Baudelaire.

In Munich, Benjamin also met the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and authored a paper on the poet Hölderlin.</span></p>\n",

Benjamin was one of the first who dealt intensively with Kafka's work and its Jewish contexts. In this text he also discusses exhaustively a number of famous works by Kafka, among them <i>The Trial</i>. Like others, this typescript with Benjamin's own handwritten corrections, was sent by him to Scholem, who had already been living in Jerusalem for over a decade.</span></p>\n",

The room in the cellar is taken up by Lea (the maid), and it is doubtful whether this room is suited for living, especially when it comes to Franz. Even Lea had not wanted this room…As long as mother is here, we do not have a spare room. Even if she leaves – who knows when that will happen – there will still be the problem of attending to Franz. It is one thing to help him as much as possible when he is living abroad, but it's another, when you invite him to our home and take upon yourself the responsibility and the care. This will end up at the expense of the children! … You know that I love Franz very much, and would like him to stay with me, but I ask you to make no commitments or to build up (his) hopes.\"</p>\n",

Despite this he wrote almost incessantly, writing stories, novels and letters. Yet, he was extremely critical regarding his works; as a result, many of his texts remained unfinished. Thus, his three famous novels, <i>The Castle</i>, <i>The Trial</i>, <i>The Missing Man</i>, as well as a number of stories were found unfinished by his close friend, the writer Max Brod. One of the most famous stories is <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, relating the story of the miserable Gregor Samsa who woke up one morning finding himself transformed into a huge insect.</p>\n",

Although ill, crippled and almost blind, he was not deterred from composing books in which he attacked his fellow Rabbis. He was therefore often censured, and constantly had to wander destitute, from one place to the other. He was especially known as a scholar of the Mesorah which aimed at determining the precise text of the Torah, and was the author of many original compositions related to Jewish sources, Kabbalah, and Hebrew poetry and grammar.</span></p>\n",
