   "data": "<p>In a gradual process which began in the last quarter of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and  continued until the rise of the Nazis, Jews in the German-speaking world had made a transition from exclusion to acceptance. While until then Jews who wanted to take part in these societies usually had to convert to Christianity, a definite change took place after 1848, when many former restrictions were lifted. Jews were especially successful in the employment of these opportunities for advancement through education. It is this trend which allowed Kafka Zweig, and Benjamin to study at the university, and made the idea of Benjamin receiving a university position tenable.  Jews had become intellectual leaders in the German-speaking world. </p>\n\n\n",

Despite this he wrote almost incessantly, writing stories, novels and letters. Yet, he was extremely critical regarding his works; as a result, many of his texts remained unfinished. Thus, his three famous novels, <i>The Castle</i>, <i>The Trial</i>, <i>The Missing Man</i>, as well as a number of stories were found unfinished by his close friend, the writer Max Brod. One of the most famous stories is <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, relating the story of the miserable Gregor Samsa who woke up one morning finding himself transformed into a huge insect.</p>\n",

The room in the cellar is taken up by Lea (the maid), and it is doubtful whether this room is suited for living, especially when it comes to Franz.

It is one thing to help him as much as possible when he is living abroad, but it's another, when you invite him to our home and take upon yourself the responsibility and the care. This will end up at the expense of the children! … You know that I love Franz very much, and would like him to stay with me, but I ask you to make no commitments or to build up (his) hopes.\"</p>\n",

One of his most famous poems, “Gift to the Noble (or Gift of the Freemen),” is a collection of aphorisms and moral parables in rhymed poetic stanzas. &#160;Jami presented this collection to the leader of the Naqshbandis, who was also known as “Lord of the Nobles/Freemen.” This manuscript was copied in 1484, just three years after Jami composed the poem.
