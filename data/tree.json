With the invention of the printing press it became worthwhile to produce large and detailed drawings which were then printed in several editions. These drawings are often called maps, although they were really often rather naïve and romantic impressions. Diachronic in nature, they often record events from the past and the future on one map. Favored scenes are the land as promised to Abraham, or Jerusalem in the time of Jesus. The readers were thus introduced to this unique site where momentous events occurred and are yet to occur in the future.</span></p>\n",

The room in the cellar is taken up by Lea (the maid), and it is doubtful whether this room is suited for living, especially when it comes to Franz. Even Lea had not wanted this room…As long as mother is here, we do not have a spare room. Even if she leaves – who knows when that will happen – there will still be the problem of attending to Franz. It is one thing to help him as much as possible when he is living abroad, but it's another, when you invite him to our home and take upon yourself the responsibility and the care. This will end up at the expense of the children! … You know that I love Franz very much, and would like him to stay with me, but I ask you to make no commitments or to build up (his) hopes.\"</p>\n",

In view of his situation he moved into a hotel and was immediately visited by a doctor from Port-Bou, whose report certified that &#160;Mr. Walter was suffering from cerebral congestion and a bronchial catarrh which forced him to stay in bed. The same doctor certifies that don Benjamin Walter passed away at 22:00 on the 26<sup>th</sup> of the same month, as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
