Favored scenes are the land as promised to Abraham, or Jerusalem in the time of Jesus.

Equally important, is the scene on the top left, showing Jesus exorcising a demon, watched from above by God and the Holy Spirit, with the Crucifixion in the background.

Thus, his three famous novels, <i>The Castle</i>, <i>The Trial</i>, <i>The Missing Man</i>, as well as a number of stories were found unfinished by his close friend, the writer Max Brod. One of the most famous stories is <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, relating the story of the miserable Gregor Samsa who woke up one morning finding himself transformed into a huge insect.</p>\n",

It is one thing to help him as much as possible when he is living abroad, but it's another, when you invite him to our home and take upon yourself the responsibility and the care. This will end up at the expense of the children! … You know that I love Franz very much, and would like him to stay with me, but I ask you to make no commitments or to build up (his) hopes.\"</p>\n",

De Lonzano, an important scholar and a colourful figure, recorded the lessons from two famous students of R.

Although ill, crippled and almost blind, he was not deterred from composing books in which he attacked his fellow Rabbis. He was therefore often censured, and constantly had to wander destitute, from one place to the other. He was especially known as a scholar of the Mesorah which aimed at determining the precise text of the Torah, and was the author of many original compositions related to Jewish sources, Kabbalah, and Hebrew poetry and grammar.</span></span></span></p>\n",
