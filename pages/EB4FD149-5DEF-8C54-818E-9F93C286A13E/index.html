  <h1>Journey of the Edel Torah</h1>

  
<p>The Scroll seen here was donated to the NLI by the Adini-Edel family.</p>
<p>Unlike the Torah scrolls usually used in Synagogues, this is a miniature scroll,</p>
<p>written in micrographic script.</p>
<p>It was either written or owned by a well-known Jewish scholar from eastern</p>
<p>Europe by the name of Rabbai Judah Edel (1757 â€“ 1828), who in his capacity as a</p>
<p>preacher travelled much and needed a compact version of the Torah to take with</p>
<p>him. After it was donated to the library it turned out that one of the library's most</p>
<p>experienced manuscript experts was a descendent of Rabbai Edel.</p>
