                <p><span>With the rise of Hitler to power in 1933 Zweig's books were condemned in Germany and later banned. Fascism was on the rise in Austria as well, and when in 1934 the police came to search Zweig's home, he left his house never to return again. It was at this time that he divorced his first wife and moved to London, writing later that at that time he sensed the heavy clouds which were hanging above. At this point, Zweig dispersed his papers and sold his manuscript collection.</span></p>

                <p><span>In 1939 Zweig married his secretary Lotte Altmann. During these years Zweig did not express himself prominently against the Nazis or in support of the persecuted Jews, and was criticized for it by major Jewish figures like Hannah Arendt. He seems to have wanted to carry one with his life in London without much interference. Yet, it was at this time, that his writing started to center upon tormented figures, both literary and historical, who are in perilous situations. It was at this time that he wrote the biographies of Mary Queen of Scots and Marie-Antoinette, the novel <i>Beware of Pity</i>, and the novella <i>The Chess Story</i> which bears autobiographical elements.</span></p>

In the <i>World of Yesterday</i>, which Zweig wrote before his death, he describes the Jewish refugees in London, as "ghosts" looking for a country to receive them. In 1940 the Zweigs left for New-York only to discover that he was surrounded again by refugees which reminded him of the terrible events in Europe. Just a few months later the Zweigs, having taken a tour of South-America, left for Petropolis Brazil, not far from Rio de Janeiro, where they hoped to have a chance for a fresh start. Zweig even wrote a book: <i>Brazil – The Land of the Future</i>.</span></p>
