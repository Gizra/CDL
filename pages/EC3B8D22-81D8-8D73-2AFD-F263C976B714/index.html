His father was a textile manufacturer, and his mother came from a Jewish banking family. As early as his teens, Zweig sent poems and articles to literary journals and corresponded with important literary figures. He also started a collection of manuscripts which included manuscripts of Goethe and Beethoven's works. Later, this collection came to include a catalogue of Mozart's works written in Mozart's own hand.</span></p>

Zweig was conscripted and assigned to serve in the Austrian Archives of the Ministry of War. Having been exposed to the horrors of the war, Zweig underwent a significant change, and wrote a fervent anti-war drama called "Jeremiah" which won the acclaim of his friend, the famous author Thomas Mann. It was at that time, that Zweig adopted an extreme pacifist position, as did his friend the French novelist Romain Rolland. He then moved to Switzerland until the end of the war. Zweig remained a pacifist all of his life and advocated for the unification of Europe.</span></span></span></p>

In the following years he wrote a series of novellas and biographical works, which were full of emotional tension and situations of social and psychological crises revolving around issues such as gambling, prostitution, adultery, and suicide.
