As early as his teens, Zweig sent poems and articles to literary journals and corresponded with important literary figures.

Fascism was on the rise in Austria as well, and in 1934 the police came to search Zweig's home. Zweig left his house, never to return again. It was then that he divorced his first wife and moved to London. &#160;Later he wrote that at that time he sensed the heavy clouds that were hanging above. At this point, Zweig dispersed his papers and sold his manuscript collection.</span></span></span></p>

During these years Zweig did not come out against the Nazis or, in support of the persecuted Jews, and was criticized for it by major Jewish figures like Hannah Arendt. He seems to have wanted to carry on with his life in London without much interference. Yet, it was at this time, that his writing started to center around tormented figures, both literary and historical, who are in perilous situations. It was during this period that he wrote the biographies of Mary Queen of Scots and Marie-Antoinette, the novel </span></span><i><span><span>Beware of Pity</span></span></i><span><span>, and the novella </span></span><i><span><span>The Chess Story</span></span></i><span><span> which bears autobiographical elements.</span></span></span></p>

In 1940 Zweig left for New-York only to discover that he was once again surrounded by refugees, reminding him of the terrible events in Europe. Just a few months later the Zweigs, having taken a tour of South-America, left for Petropolis, Brazil, not far from Rio de Janeiro, where they hoped to have a chance for a fresh start.
