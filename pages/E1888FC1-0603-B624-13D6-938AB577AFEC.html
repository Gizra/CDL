  <h1>Intellectual milieu and influences</h1>
   <p>Maimonides was greatly influenced by Muslim philosophers who combined Aristotelian and Neoplatonic philosophy, such as Farabi, Ibn Sina&#160; (Avicenna),&#160; and the Spanish Ibn Bajja (Avempace) (Zaragoza 1095-1138). Maimonides’ writings influenced the great Christian scholastic theologians such as Aquinas and Albertus Magnus, &#160;and, in later centuries , Spinoza and Leibnitz.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p>

        <h1>His Death</h1>
         <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >Maimonides passed away in 1204 in Egypt and was buries there, but early Jewish tradition claims that he had asked to be buried in the Holy Land and that his boned were brought to burial in Tiberias, where his tomb is still shown.</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >A very known Hebrew proverb in Maimonides' memory is &quot;From moses to Moses no one was as great as Moses&quot;, meaning that from the biblical Moses to Moses son of Maymon (Maimonides), no one was their match in the leadership of the Jewish people and the knowledge of the Torah. This proverb was inscribed on his grave at Tiberias.&#160;</p>

        <h1>Master of Jewish Law, Mathematics, Philosophy, Theology, and Medicine</h1>
         <p><span >In medieval Spain, these sciences were components of a curriculum shared by young&#160; Jewish and Muslim scholars of the educated classes who were part of a lively intellectual milieu.&#160; It was during this period that he mentions having met the famous Muslim mathematician and astronomer&#160;&#160; Jabir b. Aflah al-Ishbili.&#160;</span></p> <p>In these early years he wrote treatises on Logic, and on Geometry and Optics.&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p>

        <h1>The family is forced to leave Cordoba</h1>
         <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >In 1148 Cordoba was taken over by the intolerant dynasty of the <i>Muwahhidun</i> (Almohads), who by then ruled most of the Maghreb as well. The Almohads deprived the non-Muslim communities of their previous rights and persecuted them with threats of forced conversion or deportation. The Maimonides family, like many others, left Cordoba and began an extended period of wandering.</p> 
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h1>1160-1165 Morocco - forced conversion</h1>
         <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >In 1160 the family settled in Fez, Morocco which was also under the rule of the Almohads as well, where Maimonides witnessed terrible persecutions.</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It seems that during this period the family was forced to convert.</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >This is probably why sometime between 1160-1165 Maimonides wrote <b><i>The Letter on Forced Conversions</i></b> &#160;which pardoned fake conversion to Islam in cases of forced conversion. <span >&#160;</span></p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Fez Maimonides continued studying medicine, mainly through apprenticeship.</p> <p>&#160;</p> 
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h1>Pilgrimage to the Holy Land</h1>
         <p>In 1165 the Maimonides' family left for Palestine, which was ruled at that time by the Crusaders. They visited&#160; Acre, Jerusalem and Hebron.</p> <p>&#160;</p> 
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h1>The Family moves to Old Cairo (Fustat)</h1>
         <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >In 1166 the family settled in Fustat (old Cairo), then under Fatimid rule. The Fatimids were tolerant rulers, and their theology encouraged the study of philosophy. Maimonides, protected by the Fatimid rule, took to teaching Greek sciences and philosophy. During the first five years in Fustat, Maimonides completed his first major legal treatise, the Commentary on the Mishnah, a work that he composed over the long years of travels.&#160;</p>

        <h1>Maimonides becomes Court  Physician of the Ayyubids</h1>
         <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >Maimonides'&#160; family made its living from commerce, and Maimonides was supported by his brother David who traded with India.</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >In 1171 Egypt was conquered by the Ayyubid dynasty.&#160; Around the same time Maimonides'&#160; brother David drowned drowned during a commercial trip to India, and Maimonides, sick with grief over his brother, was forced to begin work as a court physician for the royal family.</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; dir=&quot;RTL&quot; >&#160;</p> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p> <p>During these years he wrote many important medical treatises, in which he sought to simplify and render more systematic the medical tradition of Galen (2ed cent') transmitted through the Muslim world. His treatises were translated to Latin during the 13<sup>th</sup> century and thus influenced medical knowledge in the medieval West.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >&#160;</p>

      <li>
        <h1>Appointed Head of the  Jewish Community</h1>
         <p>During this period Maimonides was recognized as the highest spiritual authority of his time and served for some years also as head &#160;of the Jewish community &#160;in Egypt (<i>Rais al-Yahud</i>). His numerous legal and theological responses to queries from Jews in Egypt, the Middle East, and Europe attest to his local authority and international prestige.</p> <p>The stability of Maimonides’ later life in Ayyubid Egypt enabled him to compose many treatises, including his two most important works: the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>&#160; and the <i>Guide to the Preplexed</i>.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>photos: The Ben Ezra synagogue, the ancient synagogue in old Cairo (Fustat), where Maimonides led the Jewish liturgy, also shown are the works of preservation and construction</p>
