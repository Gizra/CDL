  <h1>Mattheus Seutter's Map of the Holy Land</h1>

  
<p  >Matthaeus Seutter's map of Palestine, was part of his atlas, which was popular in Europe in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The map, based on a prototype made a century earlier by Sanson, aims to depict to the Christian European audience the Holy Land from its beginning until the Roman period, covering the period of the events told in the Old and New Testament. Not less important than the map is the scene on the top left, showing Jesus exorcising a demon, watched from above by God and the Holy Spirit, and Crucifixion in the background. On the bottom right the route of the&#160; Exodus from Egypt is depicted separately.</p>
