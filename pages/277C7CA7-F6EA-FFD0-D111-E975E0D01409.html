  <h1>The 'Damascus Crown' from Spain</h1>
   <p dir=&quot;LTR&quot; >There are several exquisite Jewish Bible codices at the NLI known as 'Damascus Crowns'. One of the Crowns was written in Burgos, Spain, and dates from around 1260. After 1492 the Jewish exiles from Spain brought the Burgos bible with them to Damascus where it was used by the local Jewish community for hundreds of years. In 1940, in the wake of the political turmoil in Syria, it disappeared.&#160; After 22 years, in 1962, it was suddenly presented and offered for the highest bidder on a public auction in London.&#160; Later that year the Burgos bible was purchased by the National Library of Israel. &#160;The Manuscript is beautifully and delicately illuminated.&#160;</p> <p dir=&quot;LTR&quot; >&#160;</p> <p  dir=&quot;RTL&quot;>&#160;</p>
