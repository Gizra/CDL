<p  >Christian van Adrichom was a Catholic priest and theologian who was a native of Delft, who fled to Cologne due to the religious turmoils of the Reformation. His map of Jerusalem is part of his book on the antiquities and history of the Holy Land which was published in 1584. The map is an imaginary map which is based on the texts he was familiar with, including the Bible, Josephus Flavius, and many other sources and has little relation to the geographical setting of the city. Although it depicts Jerusalem in the time of Jesus, it includes a variety of illustrations from sundry historical periods. Adrichom's map was one of the most popular and influential maps of the period and was copied by many.</p>
