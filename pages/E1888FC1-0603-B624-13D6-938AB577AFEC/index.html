  <h1>Intellectual milieu and influences</h1>

  
<p>Maimonides was greatly influenced by Muslim philosophers who combined Aristotelian and Neoplatonic philosophy, such as Farabi, Ibn Sina&#160; (Avicenna),&#160; and the Spanish Ibn Bajja (Avempace) (Zaragoza 1095-1138). Maimonides’ writings influenced the great Christian scholastic theologians such as Aquinas and Albertus Magnus, &#160;and, in later centuries , Spinoza and Leibnitz.</p>

<p  align=&quot;left&quot; >A very known Hebrew proverb in Maimonides' memory is &quot;From moses to Moses no one was as great as Moses&quot;, meaning that from the biblical Moses to Moses son of Maymon (Maimonides), no one was their match in the leadership of the Jewish people and the knowledge of the Torah. This proverb was inscribed on his grave at Tiberias.&#160;</p>

<p  align=&quot;left&quot; >In 1148 Cordoba was taken over by the intolerant dynasty of the <i>Muwahhidun</i> (Almohads), who by then ruled most of the Maghreb as well. The Almohads deprived the non-Muslim communities of their previous rights and persecuted them with threats of forced conversion or deportation. The Maimonides family, like many others, left Cordoba and began an extended period of wandering.</p>

Maimonides, protected by the Fatimid rule, took to teaching Greek sciences and philosophy. During the first five years in Fustat, Maimonides completed his first major legal treatise, the Commentary on the Mishnah, a work that he composed over the long years of travels.&#160;</p>

<p>During these years he wrote many important medical treatises, in which he sought to simplify and render more systematic the medical tradition of Galen (2ed cent') transmitted through the Muslim world. His treatises were translated to Latin during the 13<sup>th</sup> century and thus influenced medical knowledge in the medieval West.</p>

<p>During this period Maimonides was recognized as the highest spiritual authority of his time and served for some years also as head &#160;of the Jewish community &#160;in Egypt (<i>Rais al-Yahud</i>). His numerous legal and theological responses to queries from Jews in Egypt, the Middle East, and Europe attest to his local authority and international prestige.</p>
<p>The stability of Maimonides’ later life in Ayyubid Egypt enabled him to compose many treatises, including his two most important works: the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>&#160; and the <i>Guide to the Preplexed</i>.</p>
