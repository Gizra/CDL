  <h1>Olfert Dapper's map of Jerusalem</h1>

  
<p>Dapper (1635-1689), who never travelled outside Holland, collected much information about the Holy Land and many other countries. His realistic map (1677) relied on a Bernardino Amico's map who was a Franciscan monk in Jerusalem between 1593-1597. Amico, in his turn, copied a map made by the Franciscan monk Antonio d'Angelis who had served in Jerusalem a few years before; his map continued to be copied by generations of Christian map-makers.</p>
<p  >The map does not identify the religious affiliation of the monuments by a Cross or Crescent, and calls the Mosques on the Temple Mount â€“ &quot;The Pagan Church&quot;.&#160;</p>
