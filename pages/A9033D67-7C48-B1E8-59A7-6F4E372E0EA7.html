  <h1>Newton's Theological Papers</h1>
   <p  >Isaac Newton (1642-1727), the a world-famous <span><span >&#160;</span></span> <a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics&quot; title=&quot;Physics&quot;><span >physicist</span></a><span><span >&#160;</span></span><span >and&#160;</span><a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methematics&quot; title=&quot;Methematics&quot;><span >mathematician</span></a>, was a central <span><span >figure in the scientific revolution</span></span>.</p> <p  >7500 papers, written in Newton's own hand, are preserved in the collections of the National Library of Israel. These divulge an unknown side of Newton's personality. Besides being a scientist, Newton was an avid (though unusual) Christian believer, who took &#160;a special interest in the Scriptures, believing that a deep understanding of the text will allow him to unravel the secrets of the end of days and to compute the date of&#160; Christ's Second Coming and the Apocalypse. Of special importance is Newton's deep interest in &#160;the Jewish sources, and his view regarding the role they of the Jews &#160;in the process of salvation.</p>
