                <p><span><b><span>The Scroll served the community of Kahal-Shalom for over 400 years, until the island was occupied by the Nazis, and most of its Jews were transported to Auschwitz and were exterminated. From the 2000 members of the Island's Jewish community, 1673 were deported. Of these, only 151 survived.&#160;</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>The Torah Scroll was saved through the good relations of the Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as through an intriguing family connection: the Scroll was deposited with the Mufti of Rhodes, Suleyman Kasiloglou, just a few days before the deportation on July 25th 1944. &#160;Kasiloglu's father in law was Jewish, what may explain why the Jewish community trusted him with its most valuable possession. &#160;Kasiloglou hid the Torah under the pulpit of the Morad Reis mosque. .</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>The Scroll remained rolled on the last portion which was read in the Synagogue, "Parashat Pinhas",on the Sabbath of July 15th 1944. This same part in the scroll was heavily damaged by mildew due to the conditions in the hiding place.&#160;</span></b></span></p>
