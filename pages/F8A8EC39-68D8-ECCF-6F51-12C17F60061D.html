  <h1>A national language</h1>
   <p ><span >During the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, when National movements in Europe arose, the Jewish Zionist movement was one of them. The revival of the ancient Hebrew language was one of the important goals of the Zionist movement. This explains why Elimelech Bash chose to write his diary in Hebrew.</span></p> <p ><span >Today, Hebrew is the official language of Israel and is the main spoken language in the country.</span></p> <p ><span >&#160;</span></p> <p ><span >Photo: <i>Hatikva</i>, Hymn of the state of Israel, written by Naphtali Herz Imber, in his own hanwriting. &#160;1907-8.</span></p>
