  <h1>What is the Mishnah?</h1>
   <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >Alongside the Torah (the Pentateuch), which is the written&#160; law of the Jews,&#160; there developed an oral tradition of interpretation. This tradition was put down in writing and sealed in the beginning of the third century CE by Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Nassi , the head of the Jewish&#160; Assembly, since it was feared at that time that the tradition would be lost. The <i>Mishnah</i> is considered to be a source of religious legal authority second only to the written Torah.</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >&#160;</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >photo: A paragraph from the Mishnah, preserved in the Cairo Genizah: &quot;Rabbi Yohanan said: Whoever fulfills the Torah despite poverty, will ultimately fulfill it in wealth; but whoever neglects the Torah because of wealth, will ultimately neglect it in poverty.&quot;</p>
