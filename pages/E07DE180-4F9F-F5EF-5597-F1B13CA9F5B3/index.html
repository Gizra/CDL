  <h1>Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah</h1>

  
<p  ><span>Moses Maimonides (born Cordoba 1138 â€“ d. Cairo 1204) <span >is considered one of the greatest Jewish scholars and intellectuals of all times.</span></span></p>
<p  align=&quot;left&quot; >Maimonides was first and foremost a preeminent interpreter of Jewish law (<i>Halakah</i>), producing groundbreaking legal codes, commentaries and wide-ranging legal opinions as leader of numerous Jewish communities. Yet was also a widely influential <a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_philosophy&quot;><span ><span >philosopher</span></span></a><span >,&#160;</span> <span >and physician, famous &#160;throughout </span>Jewish, <a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages&quot;><span ><span >Muslim</span></span></a><span ><span > and Christian intellectual circles of his time</span></span><span >. </span><span><span >&#160;</span></span><span >Maimonides constantly strove to reconcile </span><span>his knowledge<span > of philosophy and science with Jewish law and theology.</span><span >&#160;</span></span></p>
<p  >Due both to his impressive intellectual horizons and to his outstanding influence among Jews and non-Jews Maimonides was known in Jewish tradition as <b>The Great Eagle</b>.</p>
<p><span >Maimonides' personal biography is representative of the fate of Spanish Jews at that time: born in Cordoba, where he absorbed Islamic science and culture, he fled from the intolerant Almohads&#160; to Morocco and then to Fustat (Cairo) in Egypt, where he received the patronage of the Ayyubid court.&#160;</span></p>
