  <h1>Commentary on the Mishnah</h1>

  
<p><span ><span >As in other scholarly fields, Maimonides broke new ground to write a commentary directly on the </span><i><span >Mishnah</span></i><span >. &#160;Maimonides began composing his commentary &#160;in 1161 while living in in Morocco and completed it in Egypt in 1168. The NLI owns an autograph, that is one of the unique manuscripts written in Maimonides' own hand, of two parts, </span><i><span >Nashim</span></i><span >, and </span><i><span >Mo'ed</span></i><span >.</span></span></p>
<p >&#160;</p>
<p><span ><span >This is a page from </span><i><span >Seder Mo'ed</span></i><span > –&quot;Festival&quot; . </span></span><span ><span ><span >Although this is already a &quot;clean&quot; copy, one can see here many changes. The large number of notes and corrections in the autograph, are evidence of &#160;Maimonides' dynamic thinking and constant development. &#160;Maimonides was an original philosopher and thinker who never ceased to ask questions and to improve his works.&#160;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span >The Commentary remained in the use of the family and in the books in the NLI there are notes which were made by Maimonides' son Abraham, and his grandson David, both of whom were scholars and leaders of the community.</span></p>
