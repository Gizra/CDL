  <h1>The language of the Commentary</h1>
   <p  align=&quot;left&quot; ><span >The commentary was written in Judeo-Arabic , a dialect of Arabic that was spoken by Jews&#160; living in the Arabic speaking world from the eighth century onwards, and is still spoken by some Jews today. &#160;Although the language was Arabic, it was written in Hebrew letters. Many of the great medieval works of Jewish law and thought were written in Judeo-Arabic.</span></p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >&#160;</p> <p  align=&quot;left&quot; >&#160;</p>
