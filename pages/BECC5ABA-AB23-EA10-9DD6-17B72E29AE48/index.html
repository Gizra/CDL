                <p>Franz Kafka was born in 1883, to a German-speaking Jewish family. He was the first of six children, though only he and his three sisters reached adulthood. His father, who ran a retail business, was a domineering uneducated man, while his mother was a quiet, shy, well-educated woman. &#160;Kafka suffered from his father's authoritarian attitude; this relationship left a dominant mark on his psyche, as is evident from the <i>Letter to His Father</i> (early 1920's).</p>
<p>Kafka, who was an excellent student, studied at a German elementary school, and later in a classic German Gymnasium where High German was taught. Although he spoke Czech, he cultivated his German and identified with the German culture.</p>

              <div class=" chronological-content node-content ">
                <p>Like many middle-class Jews in Prague, Kafka chose to continue his higher education at the German Charles Ferdinand University, where he at first studied chemistry and later law. It was during this period that he made the acquaintance of&#160; Felix Weltsch, Oskar Baum, Franz Werfel, and Max Brod; Kafka, Weltsch and Brod would later call themselves <span><span>&#160;</span></span><i><span>Der enge Prager Kreis</span></i><span><span>&#160;</span></span><span>("The Close Prague Circle").</span></p>

                <p><span>After graduating in 1906 and completing his year of training, Kafka started to work as an insurance officer.</span>&#160; Kafka called this his <i>Brotberuf</i> or "Bread Job", and constantly bemoaned the fact that he did not have enough time for his real passion: writing. Despite this he wrote almost incessantly, writing stories, novels and letters. Yet, he was extremely critical regarding his works; as a result, many of his texts remained unfinished. Thus, his three famous novels, <i>The Castle</i>, <i>The Trial</i>, <i>The Missing Man</i>, as well as a number of stories were found unfinished by his close friend, the writer Max Brod. One of the most famous stories is <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, relating the story of the miserable Gregor Samsa who woke up one morning finding himself transformed into a huge insect.</p>

              <div class=" chronological-content node-content ">
                <p>Kafka had many relationships with women. He had actually been betrothed to four of them, though none of these close relationships ever ended in marriage.</p>
<p>During WWI&#160; Kafka received a draft notice.&#160; At first he was exempted by his employers; later, in 1917, when he attempted to enlist, Kafka was diagnosed with Tuberculosis, from which he suffered increasingly until his painful death in 1924.</p>

              <div class=" chronological-content node-content ">
                <p>Kafka died from tuberculosis at the age of 41; at that time the few texts he had published were known only among his friends and admirers from his close avant-garde literary circle. Fame was to come soon after his death when his best friend, Max Brod, refused to carry out Kafka's will in which he instructed him to burn all his writings. Max Brod chose to complete the many unfinished manuscripts and to publish them. Success and fame came soon afterwards!</p>
