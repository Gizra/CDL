  <h1>Jerusalem under Ottoman Rule</h1>

  
<p  >This view made by L. Mondhare in 1770 portrays Ottoman Jerusalem as a city commanded by towering minarets and crescents in a surreal mixture of imagination and reality. Prominently situated towards the left of the map is the Dome of the Rock while in the center the Church of the Holy Sepulcher stands out clearly. At the front of the sketch is the Kidron River, appearing as a broad, rushing, European style river, attesting to the artist's vivid imagination. The inscription at the bottom states that the City of David and Solomon is currently controlled by the Ottomans and notes the existence of a Franciscan monastery within the city.</p>
