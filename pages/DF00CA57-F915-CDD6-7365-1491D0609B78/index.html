          <p><span>Although from a Jewish family, Kafka's Jewish education was minimal and amounted to a few visits a year at the Synagogue. Yet, in 1911, having been enchanted by a Yiddish theatre performance, he took up the study of Yiddish language and literature; as a consequence of this his interest in Judaism was aroused. During the early 1920's in Prague Kafka started studying modern <span>Hebrew</span>. Under the influence of his last lover, Dora Diamant, who came from an Orthodox Jewish family, Kafka even showed interest in the <span>Talmud</span>! It was during that time, when they were living in Berlin, that Kafka took classes in Judaism.</span></p>

                <p>Beginning in 1917, Kafka spent time learning Hebrew, first by himself, and later with various teachers. This is one out of five booklets filled with vocabulary by Kafka and the only one kept at the National Library of Israel.</p>
<p>In his last years he studied with Pu'ah Ben Tovim, a young student from Jerusalem, who came recommended by his good friend S.H. Bergmann, and was staying as a student in Bergmann's mother home in Prague. Kafka and Ben-Tovim &#160;were reading the Hebrew novel <i>Breakdown and Bereavement</i> by Y.H. Brenner, and there are testimonies that he was able to speak and even to write simple letters in Hebrew.</p>
<p>Some of the words included in this booklet very much remind us of the imaginary world of the author: passion, cockroach, escape, illusion etc.</p>

<p>"Regarding Kafka: I would of course be very glad to have him here, but I beg you not to take this burden upon yourself and upon our house. The room in the cellar is taken up by Lea (the maid), and it is doubtful whether this room is suited for living, especially when it comes to Franz. Even Lea had not wanted this room…As long as mother is here, we do not have a spare room. Even if she leaves – who knows when that will happen – there will still be the problem of attending to Franz. It is one thing to help him as much as possible when he is living abroad, but it's another, when you invite him to our home and take upon yourself the responsibility and the care. This will end up at the expense of the children! … You know that I love Franz very much, and would like him to stay with me, but I ask you to make no commitments or to build up (his) hopes."</p>
