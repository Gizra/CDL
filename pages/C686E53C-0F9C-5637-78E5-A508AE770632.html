         <p align=&quot;justify&quot; ><span ><b><span >Our Torah Scroll dates to the 14th or 15th century. &#160;It is written upon brown colored vellum made up of 81 sheets which altogether are 45.5 meters long. It was almost certainly made in Spain for one of the Jewish communities there, as the paleographic style is that of the Spanish Jewish tradition. Additionally, on one of the rollers appears the name of the owner – Yaakov ben Abraham Mar Hayyim, a member of a well-known Jewish family in Spain before the expulsion of the Jews in 1492.</span></b></span></p> <p align=&quot;justify&quot; ><span ><b><span >The attached songs are representative of the rich culture of the Sepharadic jews, which were exiled in 1492 and spread all around Europe.</span></b></span></p> <p align=&quot;justify&quot; >&#160;</p>
