  <h1>A Journey through Space and Time</h1>
   <p  ><span >The most striking element about these maps is that often they do not present contemporary realistic depictions as is usually the case with maps of cities or countries. Instead, they can be mostly imaginary, showing for example the land promised to Abraham, or Jerusalem in the time of Jesus; they can also be diachronic, recording traditions and events from the past and the future on one map, often mixing reality with tradition. In this way they share with their readers the experience of this unique site where momentous events occurred and are yet to occur in the future.</span></p>
