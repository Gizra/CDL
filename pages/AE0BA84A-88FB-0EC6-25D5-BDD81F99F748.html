  <h1>Christian Maps of the Holy Land</h1>
   <p  ><span >Depictions of the Holy Land and of Jerusalem appeared mostly in Bibles, in pilgrims' itineraries, in travel books, and in histories and geographies of the Holy Land. Naturally the number of such maps in manuscripts is comparatively small. However, with the invention of the printing press it became worthwhile to produce large and detailed drawings which were then printed often in several editions. These drawings are often called maps, although they were rather drawings or views which were often quite na√Øve and romantic. Our collection is made up mainly of such maps starting from the end of the 15<sup>th</sup> century onwards.</span></p>
