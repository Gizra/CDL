  <h1>Newton -  Shrewd Head of the Royal Mint</h1>

  
<p ><b>&#160;</b>Besides being a brilliant scientist and theologian, Newton was also displayed adroit skills as an administrator. In 1696 He was appointed Warden of the Royal Mint in London. In this capacity Newton wrote this letter to the tin mine owners, explaining to them through meticulous calculations that Her Majesty, Queen Anne, has already purchased from them much more tin than she can sell, leaving her with &quot;dead stock&quot; (surplus), which can only be sold at a loss.</p>
<p >He therefore announces his decision to end the contract with them.</p>

<p ><span >In these notes, written on a letter bearing the remnants of its red seal wax, Newton calculated, based on the Book of Daniel 7:25, that the end of time will arrive in the year <b>2060</b>.&#160; Newton's calculations relied on his belief that the starting point is the year 800, a time when Charlemagne founded the Holy Roman Empire and the Pope's supremacy commenced. Here, Newton believed, &#160;began the period of the &quot;apostate's&quot; church deepest corruption which will end in the Apocalyptic events <span >such as plagues and fires, the terrible battle of Armageddon and eternal damnation of the wicked </span>mentioned in the&#160; <span >Book of Revelation.&#160;</span></span></p>

        <h3 id="05C16366-E98F-8859-A0D8-AA8FE3251A80">Newton the Heretic</h3>
        
<p  >Newton's extensive study of the Christian Doctrine brought him to the conclusion that the doctrine of the Trinity was a corruption of the original biblical doctrine. He believed that the Scriptures taught that God is one person and that this one person is the Father, while Christ is the literal Son of God, having no human father.</p>
<p  >Newton hid his beliefs. Had his contemporaries known of them he would have been considered a heretic. He however, believed that he was the true Orthodox.</p>
<p  >&#160;</p>
<p  >&#160;</p>
<p  dir=&quot;RTL&quot; ><span >על גבי הצילום:</span></p>
<p  ><span >Par. 1 - The [word] God is no where in the scriptures used to signify more than the three persons at once.</span></p>
<p  ><span >Par. 3 – When ever it is said in the scriptures that there is but one God, it is meant of the Father.</span></p>
<p  >&#160;</p>

        <h3 id="4130AC26-0B7C-306D-58D1-87B4DD7C00BD">Newton and the Jewish Temple</h3>
        
<p  >Newton believed that the temple described in the prophecy of Ezekiel will materialize at the End of Days. He therefore invested much effort in studying matters related to the Jewish Temple and its rituals.</p>
<p  ><span>This trilingual manuscript written in Latin, Hebrew and Greek shows that Newton was familiar not only with the work of&#160; scholars of his time but also with the ancient Jewish &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;sources including the <span >Mishna </span>, the <span >Zohar</span>, the <span >Talmud</span>, and many more.</span></p>
<p  >On the third line from the top Newton copied in meticulous Hebrew script the words:</p>
<p  ><span dir=&quot;RTL&quot; >ברוך שם כבוד מלכותו לעולם ועד&#160; - </span>&quot; - Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for all eternity&quot;.</p>

        <h3 id="BB7FB86D-54E0-57DD-EA6F-71CD5EFAE26B">Map of the Fifth and Sixth Trumpets</h3>
        
<p  >Newton's preoccupation with the Apocalypse of John elicited this realistic map of the Near East which illustrates the geography of the region in which the Apocalyptic events will occur. According to Revelation 9 four angels will be released on the Euphrates river and will punish the sinners. Newton believed that the Fifth Trumpet is Islam, and the Sixth – the Ottoman Empire and identified as these four angels in the Sultanates marked out on the map<b>: Iconium, Damascus, Mosul and Miapharekin</b>,.</p>

<p  >Newton also took a deep interest in Alchemy. Although most of the Alchemical papers are in Cambridge, the NLI possesses one unique page. It is a part of Newton's copy of an English translation made in 1624 of <i>the Exposition of the Hieroglyphical figures</i> written by the famous French Alchemist Nicholas Flamel. Newton sketched Flamel's symbolic figures, and described in the text above&#160; their Alchemical role.</p>
