  <h1>Abraham Ortelius</h1>
   <p  >This map was made by the famous publisher, Abraham Ortelius active in the Low Countries during the 16th century who, in an age of great geographical discoveries was the first to print a modern atlas. Although a &quot;modern&quot; cartographer at the time, Ortelius dedicated a special map to &quot;The Life and Peregrination of the Patriarch Abraham to the Promised Land&quot;. &#160;</p> <p  ><span >The biblical passage (Genesis 12: 1-2) commanding Abraham to leave on the journey appears along the top frame of the map: </span><span >&#160;</span><i><span >“Go from your country, your people and your father’s household&#160;to the land&#160;</span><span >I will show you</span><span >&quot;</span></i>, <span >while on the bottom appears Genesis 17:8: &quot;</span><i><span >The whole land of Canaan,&#160;where you now reside as a foreigner,&#160;I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you</span></i><a id=&quot;4&quot; name=&quot;4&quot;> </a><span >.&quot;</span></p> <p  >&#160;</p>
