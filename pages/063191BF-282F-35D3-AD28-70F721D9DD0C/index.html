                <p><b><span><span><span>Walter Benjamin</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> was born to a prosperous Jewish family in Berlin on July 15, 1892. He received a private education at home until the age of ten, after which he finished high school and studied philosophy at the Humboldt University of Berlin. As WWI broke out, Benjamin was beginning to translate the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. In 1915, at the age of 23, Benjamin moved to Munich where he met Gershom Scholem, the future founder of modern Kabbalah research, with whom he forged a close friendship that would last for many years. In Munich, Benjamin also met the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and authored a paper on the poet Hölderlin.</span></span></span></p>

Scholem invited Benjamin to join him, later even trying to&#160;entice him with a lectureship at the Hebrew University, but to no avail. Benjamin had never been drawn to Zionism, seeing Judaism, like Zweig, as a spiritual-cultural force:</span></span><span><span><span> "My life experience led me to this insight: the Jews represent an elite in the ranks of the spiritually active ...
