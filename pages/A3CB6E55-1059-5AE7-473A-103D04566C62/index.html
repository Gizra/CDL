  <h1>Donation of the Papers to Cambridge  - 1872 – 1936</h1>

  
<p  >In 1872, one of Newton's descendants, the 5th Earl of Portsmouth, donated the papers to the University of Cambridge, in which Newton had studied and taught. The committee appointed by the University to review the papers, selected only Newton's scientific papers, not wanting to blemish his reputation as an enlightened intellectual and scientist.</p>
<p  >The theological papers, as well as the alchemical and the historical papers were returned to the family.</p>

<p  >Upon Newton's death in Cambridge in 1727, his relatives, the Conduitts, claimed his papers. Newton's papers reflected an array of various interests and occupations: papers in Mathematics and Physics, &#160;documents written as part of his function as head of the Royal Mint and President of the Royal Society, and&#160; the less known and more intriguing papers on Theology ,History and Alchemy.</p>

<p  >In July 1936 the papers which had been given back to the family were put up for sale by Sotheby's in London. The sale was poorly attended since at the same time, in London, Impressionist paintings were being sold at Christie's! Newton's papers were thus sold to a variety of people for the mere some of 9000 pounds.</p>

<p  >Having found out belatedly about the sale, two important scholars were resolved to purchase the papers. The first was the famous British economist, John Maynard Keynes, who strove to buy all the alchemical papers; the second was the Jerusalem born well-known Orientalist, <b>Abraham Shalom Yahuda</b>. At some point, they even exchanged some of the papers between them!</p>

<p  >While the Alchemical papers, acquired by Keynes, were bequeathed by him to Cambridge upon his death in 1946, A.S. Yahuda bequeathed his papers upon his death in 1951 to the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem, along with many other important and beautiful manuscripts of all sorts.</p>
<p  >Newton's Theological Papers were bequeathed by A.S. Yahuda &#160;to the library along with many other important Jewish, Muslim and Christian manuscripts (these include outstanding Muslim manuscripts – here is a short glimpse).</p>
