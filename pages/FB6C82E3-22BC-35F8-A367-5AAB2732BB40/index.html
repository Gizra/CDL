  <h1>The Guide of the Perplexed</h1>

  
<p>The Guide of the Perplexed, an important philosophical treatise, which was composed between 1185-1191, is set as a letter to a young disciple. The Guide sought to resolve apparent contradictions between rationalist philosophy on the one hand, and Jewish tradition found in Scripture and the Talmud, on the other hand.&#160; Unlike the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, which was written for broad use, the <i>Guide</i>, written in Judeo-Arabic,&#160; was written for a more limited audience of rationalist yet traditional Jews. A few of Maimonidesâ€™ theological positions led to public controversies with rabbinic leaders&#160; outside of Egypt towards the end of his life.</p>
