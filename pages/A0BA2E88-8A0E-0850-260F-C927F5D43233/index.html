  <h1>European Currents: Shlomo of Helm's Map of the Land of Israel</h1>

  
<p  >R. Shlomo of Helm (1717-1781) was a famous Jewish scholar and Rabbi in Poland. Although he was famous for his erudition in Jewish sources and law (<i>Halakha</i>), he chose extraordinarily to emphasize the importance of the study of Philosophy and Sciences alongside Jewish studies.</p>
<p  ><span>In the autograph manuscript of his book &quot;Hug Ha-Aretz&quot;, recently purchased by the NLI, written in beautiful classical <span >Hebrew</span> language and in handsome calligraphic script, R. Shlomo drew a series of maps of the Land of Israel divided among the Tribes. Unlike the tradition following Rashi's maps, the legends in his maps prove that he was clearly inspired by the Christian maps of the Holy Land made by Adrichom and by Seutter.</span></p>
