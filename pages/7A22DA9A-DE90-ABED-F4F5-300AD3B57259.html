  <h1>W.J. Blaeu's Map of the Holy Land</h1>
   <p><span >In 1629 W.J. Blaeu printed a new World Atlas containing 45 maps. One of these was the map of the Holy Land or the Promised Land as seen by Moses from Mt. Nevo, after forty years of wandering with the Israelites in the desert, and just before his death. Although the map is focused on Moses, the toponyms reflect the Holy Land from Biblical Times through the Hellenistic and Roman periods in Palestine. The mapmaker strove to draw an accurate map, but at this time both the knowledge and the cartographic skills were still limited.&#160;</span></p> <p>&#160;</p>
