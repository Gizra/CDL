  <h1>The Hebrew language</h1>
   <p ><span >The Hebrew language is the ancient language which was spoken and written by the people of Israel already in the beginning of the first millennium. It is the language of the Old Testament and other scriptures of the Jewish people. Although from the second temple period onwards Jews started speaking other languages as well (Aramaic, Greek and later other European vernacular languages), it remained the language of the Scriptures and prayer, and was called &quot;The Holy Tongue&quot;.</span></p> <p ><span >Jews continued to learn, to read and write Hebrew throughout the last two millennia although it was not their spoken language, since it was their ancient holy language.</span></p> <p >&#160;</p> <p ><span >Photos: The Worms prayer book. &#160;Germany, 13th century.</span></p>
