  <h1>Braun and Hogenberg's map of Jerusalem</h1>
   <p >This view of Jerusalem was one of three maps of the city included in the famous city atlas compiled by Braun and Hoghenberg in 1575. The city is seen here in the eyes of pilgrims when standing on the Mount of Olives, looking eastwards. Although the round shape of the city is schematic, there are various realistic elements such as the citadel in the background, the bridges over the Kidron valley and the blocked doorway to the church of the Holy Sepulchre. Ezek. 5:5 at the top conveys the idea of Jerusalem as the center of the earth, while the citation from Pliny the Elder on the bottom left lauds <b>&quot;Jerusalem, the most famous of the cities in the Orient, Metropolis of Judaea&quot;.</b></p>
