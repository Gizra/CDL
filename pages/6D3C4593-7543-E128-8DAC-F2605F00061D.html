  <h1>The Land of Israel and its Borders in Biblical Times – the  Jewish Tradition</h1>
   <p  ><span >This lovely hand-drawn map was created in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by an artist who claims that he copied it from the famous Jewish scholar, the Vilna Gaon (1720-1797).</span></p> <p  ><span >The map follows an ancient tradition of mapping the borders of Land of Israel, as described in Numbers 34. This tradition commenced with Rashi, the greatest Jewish commentator of the Bible, who lived in France in the 11<sup>th</sup> century.</span></p> <p  ><span >Later tradition added the allotments of the 12 tribes, and cities and settlements which are represented here as European houses with tiled roofs. Jerusalem is depicted prominently with a tower beside it bearing the inscription &quot;The Temple&quot;.</span></p>
