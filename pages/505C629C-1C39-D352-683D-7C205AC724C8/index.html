Here, Newton believed, began the period of the "Apostate" Church's deepest corruption which will end in apocalyptic events such as plagues and fires, the terrible battle of Armageddon and eternal damnation of the wicked mentioned in the Book of Revelation.</span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Newton's extensive study of Christian doctrine brought him to the conclusion that the doctrine of the Trinity was a corruption of the original Biblical doctrine. He believed that the Scriptures taught that God is one divine person and that this one divine person is the Father, while Christ is the literal Son of God, having no human father.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Newton hid his beliefs. Had his contemporaries known of them he would have been considered a heretic. He however, believed that he held the true belief.</span></span></span></p>
